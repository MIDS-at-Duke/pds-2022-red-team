## Project Description
* Project Question: what is the effect of opioid drug prescription regulations on (1) the volume of opioids prescribed and (2) drug overdose deaths.

## Data Overview
For this project, we looked at the following data: 
* Opioid Prescriptions Data (2006-2014)
* Mortality Data caused by Drug Overdose (2003-2015)
* County Population Data (2003-2015)

## Data Analysis
* Pre-Post Comparison: compares the volume of opioids prescribed and drug overdose death in a state before and after drug prescription regulations went into effect. 
  + Florida. Effective February, 2010. 
  + Texas. Effective January 4, 2007. 
  + Washington. Effective Jan 2, 2012. 
* Difference-in-Difference Approach: evaluates whether the change identified in the pre-post comparison is larger than the change that occurred in other states over the same period.
